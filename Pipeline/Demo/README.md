# Toy data for running Signature's LWLR and Community Detection (Demo)
This "Demo" folder will act as your output directory from running _cooler_. With _cooler_, all results are generated in a seperate folder for each dataset/cell type analyzed. In this case, 2 datasets would have been processed separetly: H9hESCs and Astrocytes.

## LWLR
Signature's LWLR can process both cis and trans data. The same script can be used for each (with appropriate analysis-specific modifications). In Demo, you will see toy data at the 1Mb resolution for both cis and trans. These files are the input for Signature and are named "[analysis]_
