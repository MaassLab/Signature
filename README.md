# Project Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project, "Inter-chromosomal contacts demarcate genome topology along a spatial gradient." This repository is organized into three main folders, each dedicated to a specific aspect of our research.

## 1. LWLR

In the LWLR folder, you will find the Local Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR) model. This non-parametric supervised learning approach systematically assesses relationships between all loci on all chromosomes using Hi-C/Omni-C data. The detailed information and instructions for implementing the LWLR model are provided within this folder.

## 2. Community Detection

The Community Detection folder houses scripts related to our non-overlapping Community Detection approach, specifically the pycombo method. These scripts are designed to investigate hubs (communities) of genomic interactions using Hi-C/Omni-C data. Navigate to this folder for comprehensive details on running pycombo and interpreting the results.

## 3. Figures

For those interested in the figures presented in the "Inter-chromosomal contacts demarcate genome topology along a spatial gradient" paper, the Figure folder contains the necessary scripts. These scripts involve a certain level of data pre-processing to generate the figures showcased in our research paper. Refer to this folder for insights into the data processing steps and to reproduce the figures.
