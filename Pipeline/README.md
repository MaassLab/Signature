# Modeling inter-chromosomal interactions using Hi-C data by supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
The Signature pipeline folder encompasses four key subfolders:

### a. Pre-processing
The Pre-processing folder includes scripts essential for preparing raw Hi-C data for our algorithms. This step is crucial in transforming data into a format suitable for further analysis.

### b. LWPR (Supervised Learning)
The LWPR folder contains the Local Weighted Polynomial Regression (LWPR) approach, a supervised learning method within Signature. This approach systematically assesses spatial interactions and their extent across diverse cell types. Detailed information and implementation instructions are provided within the LWLR folder.

### c. Community Detection (Unsupervised Learning)
The Community Detection folder houses scripts related to the unsupervised learning approach in Signature, specifically the Community Detection method. This method aims to uncover patterns of chromosomal interactions without prior labeling. Explore this folder for insights into the Community Detection approach and guidance on implementation.

### d. Demo
This folder contains Signature's input data (cooler interaction frequencies) for two Hi-C datasets. These files can be used as toy data for running a demo of Signature.
