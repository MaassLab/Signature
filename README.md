# Signature Repository

Welcome to the _Signature_ repository! _Signature_ is a novel machine learning method designed to comprehensively and systematically detect Chromosomal interactions, specifically focusing on non-homologous chromosomal contacts (NHCCs). NHCCs refer to interactions between different chromosomes. This repository is organized into three main folders:

# Pre-processing
The Pre-processing folder is an essential component of the Signature repository. It includes scripts for data pre-processing, transforming raw Hi-C data into a format suitable for our algorithms. Follow the guidelines provided here to prepare your data efficiently.

# LWLR (Supervised Learning)
The LWLR folder contains the Local Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR) approach, a supervised learning method within Signature. This approach assesses spatial interactions and their extent across various cell types. Detailed information and implementation instructions are provided within the LWLR folder.

# Community Detection (Unsupervised Learning)
The Community Detection folder encompasses scripts related to the unsupervised learning approach in Signature, specifically the Community Detection method. This method aims to uncover patterns of chromosomal interactions without prior labeling. Explore this folder for insights into the Community Detection approach and guidance on implementation.

Feel free to navigate through each folder to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Signature method. If you have questions, encounter issues, or wish to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out through the repository's communication channels and Maass Lab contact information (https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/maass/) . Thank you for your interest in Signature!
